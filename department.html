            <LI>The Graduates of this Programme with proficiency in mathematics and physical sciences will excel in the
                core areas of Civil Engineering such as Structural, Environmental and Water Resources Engineering.</LI>
            <LI>The graduates will plan, produce detailed drawings, write specification, and prepare cost estimates.
            </LI>
            <LI>The graduates will interact with stakeholders effectively and execute quality construction work applying
                necessary tools.</LI>
        </OL>
        <H3>PEO</H3>
        <P>At the outset all the graduates will be actively engaged in a professional career as a civil engineer or
            pursuing advanced study. They will understand professional practice issues and demonstrate a commitment to
            professional licensure and continuing education. They also perched by the morels and the principles of
            sustainable development and global interconnectedness, which make them to understand how civil engineering
            projects affect or effects the society and the environment.</P>

        <H3>MISSION</H3>

        <P> A collective hub where leading Civil Engineering research serves the needs of a broad array of disciplines
            and where innovations in other fields are applied to enrich Civil Engineering research and practice.</P>
        <H3>VISION</H3>
        <P Provide knowledge and tools that enable Civil Engineering to evolve away from empirical adhoc approaches into
            strategies based on scientifically grounded analysis, using fundamental mechanics, integrating uncertainty,
            and navigating the conflicting objectives inherent in successful Civil Engineering design.></P>
